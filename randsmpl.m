function x = randsmpl(p, m, n, varargin)
%RANDSMPL  Independent sampling from a discrete distribution.
%          
%   x = randsmpl(p, m, n) returns an m-by-n matrix x of random samples
%   drawn independently from the input (discrete) distribution specified
%   with pmf p. Suppose that the sample space comprises K samples, then p
%   must be a (row- or column-) vector containing K probability masses 
%   summing to 1. The output, x(i,j) = k, k = 1, ..., K, describes that
%   the k-th sample is drawn in the (i,j)-th trial, for i = 1, ..., m and
%   j = 1,...,n. The default output data type of x is 'double'.
%
%   x = randsmpl(p, m, n, classname) returns an m-by-n matrix x whose data  
%   type is specified by classname. The classname must be a valid numeric 
%   class name which includes the following
%     'double' (default) | 'single' | 'int64'  | 'int32' | 'int16' | ...
%      'int8' | 'uint64' | 'uint32' | 'uint16' | 'uint8' | 
%   If classname is not provided, the default 'double' type is used. 
%
%   Remarks:
%       - The main idea is to divide interval [0,1] into K disjoint bins, 
%         each with length proportional to the corresponding probability
%         mass. Then, we draw samples from the unfiorm distribution U(0,1)  
%         and determine the indices of the bins containing those samples.    
%
%       - histc and histcounts (introduced in R2014b) determine not only  
%         the indices of the bins, but also the histogram counts within 
%         each bin. In contrast, discretize (introduced in R2015a) is aimed
%         solely for finding the indices of the histogram bins, thus is
%         much faster than histc and histcounts. We also observed that
%         discretize is considerably more efficient in terms of memory 
%         consumption compared to histc. Thus, for both performance and
%         memory considerations, we use discretize.
%
%       - Two alternatives to discretize are also provided for backward 
%         compatibility with earlier releases, e.g., R2014b or earlier:
%         1) discretizemex (already included in the folder): the binary mex 
%            file of discretize;
%         2) interp1 instead: though slightly slower than discretize, the
%            performance penalty is not significant.
